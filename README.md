Face Attendance System 📸
This project is a Face Recognition-based Attendance System that provides two modes of operation:

Real-time attendance marking (one by one)
Attendance marking for a group using a single photo
It uses face recognition technology to efficiently and accurately manage attendance records.

📁 Project Structure
main.py: The main script that runs the attendance system, allowing real-time and group photo-based attendance marking.
encode_generator.py: Script to generate and store face encodings for individuals to be used in the system.
database.py: Script managing the database for attendance records, including storing and retrieving attendance data.
group_photo.py: Script for processing a group photo to mark attendance for multiple people simultaneously.
encode_generated.p: Pre-generated face encodings for individuals, used by the system for recognition.
🚀 Features
Real-time Attendance Marking

The system identifies and marks attendance for individuals as they are scanned one by one.
Group Photo Attendance

Attendance can be marked for multiple individuals using a single group photo.
Database Integration

Attendance records are automatically updated in a database.
Efficient Face Encoding

Pre-generated face encodings ensure fast and accurate recognition.
🌐 Suggested Database Integration
While this project includes a basic local database for storing attendance records (e.g., SQLite), Firebase or a similar cloud database is recommended for:

Real-time Data Sync: Instantly update and retrieve attendance data across multiple devices or platforms.
Scalability: Effortlessly handle a growing number of users and records.
Remote Access: Allow users to access attendance data from anywhere, using a web or mobile app.
Enhanced Security: Benefit from built-in authentication and secure storage options.
